  ### I help companies manage volatility.

  I create value for clients by providing capital solutions and analytical support to help them manage volatility, protect their balance sheet, and meet their financial objectives. I enjoy learning, working with stakeholders, and making better decisions with data.
  
  
  
  While I specialize in ERM / Economic Capital Modeling but my interests are too broad to be considered a specialist. I have a passon for building models and learning, especially in the fields of probability & statistics, finance and risk and uncertainty. When I am not reading, I enjoy football, (strong) coffee and vacationing with my family.
