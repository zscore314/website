  ### I design and build awesome data science products.

  I love helping data scientists. My passion is training. But, when I am not making new courses or building software, I enjoy vacationing with my family and friends.
  
  
  My area of focus is applying data science to business. I create value for companies by understanding the financial cost of problems and delivering a return-on-investment with my solutions. I enjoy learning, working with stakeholders, and making better decisions with data.
